Description:

The bean 'modelMapper', defined in com.shruteekatech.electronic.store.ElectronicStoreApplication, could not be registered. A bean with that name has already been defined in class path resource [com/shruteekatech/electronic/store/config/ProjectConfig.class] and overriding is disabled.

Action:

Consider renaming one of the beans or enabling overriding by setting spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true
